index.title=The shared travel calendar

index.explain=The <em>Who, Where, When</em> travel calendar allows groups of \
  people to share their travel schedules. You register your trips in the \
  calendar and all of the friends that you have invited into your circle \
  can see your schedule and you theirs. By making this information \
  available, you\'ll hopefully prevent those annoying situations where you \
  find out after the fact that one of your friends was spitting distance \
  from you while you were off traveling through some exotic locale. On the \
  other hand, you may just keep in better contact with your friends. \
  \
  <p> For the visually curious, this is what it looks like:

index.need_account=To make use of the service you''ll need an account. If \
  you''ve already registered, you can <a href="{0}">login now</a>, \
  otherwise <a href="{1}">create an account</a> to get started.

index.closing_remarks=By the way, this is a free service and we\'re not \
  going to market to you or sell your personal information or even \
  surreptitiously start inviting you to our parties. It\'s technology \
  helping you to be closer to the people you love.  A friendly \
  neighborhood geek created this service to solve their own travel \
  coordination problems and they\'d love nothing more than to see it help \
  other people as well. So give it a try. It might make your life better.

accept.banner=Hello! You have received an invitation from <b>{0}</b> to	\
  join her/his shared travel calendar. You might be wondering what in \
  the heck this is all about; read on to find out.

# accept reuses:
# index.explain, index.need_account and index.closing_remarks

accept.invitation=Hello! You have received an invitation from <b>{0}</b> \
  to join her/his shared travel calendar. If you wish to do so, click the \
  "Accept" button below. If not, do be kind enough to send her/him an \
  email letting her/him know that you''re declining her/his invitation. \
  It''s only civil. \
  \
  <p>Thanks,<br> \
  The Who, Where, When server

accept.error.missing_param=Oops. Something seems to be wrong with the \
  invitation information provided in the URL. Make sure the URL shown \
  above matches the one you received in the email exactly and try \
  again. If it still isn\'t working, ask a friendly neighborhood geek if \
  they can figure out what the problem is. We\'d have you ask us, but there \
  is no us. We\'re just a computer. \
  \
  <p>Thanks,<br> \
  The Who, Where, When server

accept.error.no_such_user=Strange. The user that invited you to join their \
  travel calendar no longer exists. No matter. You can still make use of \
  the wonderful Who, Where, When travel coordination service despite your \
  disappearing friend. Just head over to the \
  <a href="calendar.wm">calendar</a> and check it out.

accept.error.cant_invite_self=I\'m sure you\'re your own best friend, but \
  it\'s not extremely useful for you to add yourself to your friends list \
  on Who, Where, When. We already include all of your trips automatically, \
  so as far as we\'re concerned, you and yourself are like two peas in a pod.

accept.accept.title=Accept the invitation
accept.accept.submit=Accept

accept.message.accepted=You have accepted the invitation. Welcome to the \
  club. Now just click on the "Who, Where, When" link below to check out \
  your fancy new travel calendar.

# friends.wm

friends.title=Count your friends

friends.howto=In the eyes of the Who, Where, When service, your "friends" \
  are the people with whom you share your travel calendar. How you feel \
  about these people otherwise is none of our business. None the less, we \
  encourage you to <a href="{0}">invite</a> anyone in whose travel plans \
  you find yourself interested. \
  \
  <p> If one of your beloved friends has rubbed you the wrong way and you \
  want to show them a thing or two, just click the "Excommunicate" button \
  next to their name and expunge them from your glorious travel plans like \
  the scurvy dog they are.

friends.no_friends=Awww. You have no friends. I''m sure you''re very \
  popular in real life. Maybe you should <a href="{0}">invite some</a>.

friends.error.missing_friendid=Somehow the universe has slipped into \
  disorder and certain parts of the request were provided while other \
  parts were not. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain and if \
  you thought this was going to accomplish something useful, please try \
  again.

friends.friends.title=Your friends
friends.friends.submit=Excommunicate

friends.everyone.title=The whole kit and kaboodle

friends.everyone.explain=If you''re the shy type and don''t want to run off \
  emailing all your friends about this great new tool you''ve discovered, \
  you might want to scan this list to see if any of them are already using \
  the system. If they''re a true friend, they''ll surely gladly \
  <a href="{0}">accept an invitation</a> from you to join circles.

friends.everyone.caveat=Yes, I know this isn\'t a very scalable strategy, \
  but how else am I going to get you pansies to come out of your shell and \
  share this life enhancing tool with your friends? Just send them an \
  invitation and stop worrying about whether or not they\'ll think you\'re \
  a dork for managing your travel calendar on the web.

friends.message.excommunicated=<b>{0}</b>, the rat bastard was eliminated \
  from your friends list with a merciless kick. Never again will you be \
  plagued with the sight of their worthless and paltry travel plans (at \
  least, not until you reconcile your differences and invite them back \
  into your inner circle).
